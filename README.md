# Challengepy - Server Challenge

In this challenge, I have written the backend for "Penn Club Review".

# How I stored my information

For my Clubs class I used a static variable that is a list of all Club objects that have been created in the Club class. I also stored all the usernames in another static variable. My user class also stores all the User objects that have been created and all the usernames created in two separate static variables.
